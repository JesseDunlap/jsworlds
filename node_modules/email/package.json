  "readme": "# node-email\n\nA simple wrapper for the sendmail command\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst make sure [Sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org/) is installed.\n\nthen either\n\n    npm install email\n\nor \n\n    git clone git://github.com/aheckmann/node-email.git\n\n## Examples\n    var Email = require('path/to/email').Email\n    var myMsg = new Email(\n    { from: \"me@example.com\"\n    , to:   \"you@example.com\"\n    , subject: \"Knock knock...\"\n    , body: \"Who's there?\"\n    })\n    \n    // if callback is provided, errors will be passed into it\n    // else errors will be thrown\n    myMsg.send(function(err){ ... })\n\nIn this example we set the global `from` property so that all\nemail is sent from the same address.\n    \n    var lib = require('path/to/email')\n      , Email = lib.Email;\n        \n    lib.from = 'someAddress@youAlwaysSendFrom.com'\n    \n    // no need to set the from property, already set\n    var mail = new Email(\n    { to: \"you@example.com\"\n    , subject: \"Knock knock...\"\n    , body: \"Who's there?\"\n    })\n    mail.send()\n\nNote that no callback was passed into `send()`, therefore errors will throw.\n    \n\n## Options\n \n    new Email(config)\n    \n  config options:\n  \n  - to {array|string} \n    - Email address(es) to which this msg will be sent\n  - from {string} \n    - Email address from which this msg is sent. If not set\n      defaults to the `exports.from` global setting.\n  - replyTo {string} \n    - Email address to which replies will be sent. If not set \n      defaults to `from`\n  - cc {array|string} \n    - Email address(es) who receive a copy\n  - bcc {array|string} \n    - Email address(es) who receive a blind copy\n  - subject {string} \n    - The subject of the email\n  - body {string} \n    - The message of the email\n  - bodyType {string} \n    - Content type of body. Only valid option is 'html' (for now). \n      Defaults to text/plain.\n  - altText {string}\n    - If `bodyType` is set to 'html', this will be sent as the text\n      alternative.\n  - timeout {number} \n    - Duration in milliseconds to wait before killing the process. \n      If not set, defaults to `exports.timeout` global setting.\n  - path {string}\n    - Optional path to the sendmail executable\n\n  Global settings\n  \n  - exports.timeout {number} \n    - Duration in milliseconds to wait before killing the process. \n      Defaults to 3000. Used when `timeout` is not set on a message.\n  - exports.from {string} \n    - Email address from which messages are sent. Used\n      when `from` was not set on a message.\n\n## Injection\nSome protection against injection attacks is enabled. Use at your own \nrisk.

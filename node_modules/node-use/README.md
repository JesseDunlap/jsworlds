# Introduction

**node-use** is designed to be an easy approach to global package management,
implementing a system that functions similar to traditional ``include`` statements,
like the ones found in **C#**, **C++**, **Python**, etc.

# Using node-use

1. Install **node-use** with NPM

```
npm install node-use
```

2. Require **node-use** (You only need to do this once at the beginning of your code)

```
require('node-use')
```


# node-use PATH

By default, **node-use** will search in the ``lib`` directory at your code's root
when you attempt to ``use`` a library. You can add items to the PATH by pushing
elements to the __usePATH variable:

```
__usePATH.push("path/to/your/lib/folder");
```

# use function

The ``use`` function takes a string, and can be used anywhere in your code, after
you have typed ``require('node-use')``. ``use`` will search all existing directories
in ``__usePATH``.

```
use("com.jessedunlap.SomeLibrary");
```

The above statement would look for the file ``lib/com/jessedunlap/SomeLibrary.js``.
Additionally, if the last item in the path specified is a directory, ``use`` will
automatically search that directory for all ``.js`` files.

Any files found will be added to the ``global`` object, allowing them to be utilized
globally. The file name is used to determine the key in the global object. (e.g. if the
file is named ``SomeLibrary.js`` you could then access SomeLibrary by simply writing ``SomeLibrary.whatever()``)

Libraries are written just like node modules, using ``module.exports``. Anything
exported from the module will be added to the global value.

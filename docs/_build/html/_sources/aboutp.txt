How P Works
***********

P was designed from the ground up to be a modularized, fast, real-time web framework. The basis of P is to be
a collection of **Modules**, which extend the **P Object**. The P Object is supposed to be available almost
anywhere in the framework. By having access to the P object, you have access to nearly everything the framework
has to offer, on a single-user basis.

The Goals of P
==============

* **Be Modular** - P should be able to be adapted, taken apart, minimized, or maximized via Modules.
* **Be Real-Time** - Live updating and synchronization/collaboration across multiple users.
* **Desktop-esque** - Writing a P app should be more like writing a desktop app than writing a web app.
* **Re-usable** - P code should be written from a component-based reusable standpoint, unlike most web frameworks.

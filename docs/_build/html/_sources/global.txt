Global Access
=============

P allows you to store temporary global data, which will be accessible across the entire
app, and will not differ between P clients. P's global access is a lot like the client-side
JavaScript ``window`` object.

To access the global object:

.. code-block:: javascript

   P.globe["key"] = "value";
   console.log(P.globe["key"]); // "value"
